## 💬 About Me

I'm 22 years old.

I go by many titles. Fullstack Web Developer, UI Designer, UX Designer. Depends on the project I'm working on.

#### 🏠 Location

I'm based in the Helsinki Region in Finland. In Espoo to be more specific. However, I spend a lot of my time in Vaasa, Finland.

#### 📖 Studies

I have a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Aalto University. I am also currently continuing my studies there, aiming for my masters.
#### 🎶 Freetime

My favorite thing to do in my free time is anything related to music. Playing, singing, composing, writing songs. You name it.

In addition, I am a creative person and love the medium of code. I end up every now and then coming up with a new side project to work on, to test the latest technologies on and just to have fun with.

#### 💼 Why I work

I'm truly passionate about what I create. Because of this I strive to build only high-quality products, both in terms of code quality and user experience. This means a promise to create products that satisfy not only my clients and the end users but also me as a creator.

Seeing a product become real and having poured so much of my talent and time into it never fails to bring me satisfaction.

#### 🤩 What makes me happy?

The one thing that never fails to make me happy is being around the people I love. Having a good cup of coffee, sitting somewhere comfortable with or without friends, and enjoying life.

A good game of any fun sport, usually badminton or padel, a good run or just simply sitting at a piano, playing and singing for hours.
